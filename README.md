# HVP-EDS helper scripts

xyz2eds.py
----------

xyz2eds.py is an open source script, written in Python, for preparing a set of input files for hybrid variational-perturbational energy decomposition scheme (HVP-EDS) implemented in my custom version of GAMESS(US).

geds.py

For the details of the approach and the present implementation checkout the WiKi.

The usage of the scripts is rather self-explanatory, however, I have prepared a short [Tutorial](https://github.com/rgora/HVPT-EDS/wiki/Tutorial) which is available through project's wiki.
